# Here
An attempt to write out some of the topics I look into, mostly to help future me remember and to practice writing. As such, any coding examples are largely focused on the computations they perform and not friendly naming as you would expect in real code. Think an algo book's psudo-code. 

Also fair game here would be musings about random topics and things I want to remember. 

# Me
Hi, I'm Xavier. I'm interested in a number of things including: programming, surfing, finance, machine learning, math, jazz, green housing, risk and weather modeling, and baking bread.
